Write cypress test for the following website

```
https://www.saucedemo.com/
```

The test should demonstrate an end to end multiple products purchasing behavior.

## Bonus:

1. Save information between multiple test cases. Something like [this](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cypress-localstorage-commands).
2. Create multiple useful custom cypress commands helpful in testing. [Example](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/custom-commands)
